                This document is the API specification for the TraceLogger library. The library helps to avoid errors and helps to debug
                errors during the development of complex software systems on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) by providing clearly arranged
                (trace-)logs. In contrast to conventional loggers the call stack of the to be observed methods is presented by indenting
                the trace messages dependent on the actual depth of the call stack. A distinction is made between fine granular trace messages
                (entering and exiting of methods, debugging output) and conventional log messages (error, warning and info notifications).
                For production the latter ones can be redirected to a conventional logging system like log4j2 whereas the trace messages will
                be discarded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several strategies to access tracers can be employed. Tracers can be accessed by name, can be mapped on threads and can be
                retrieved by invoking a blocking queue. Unlike conventional java loggers, these tracers aren't linked with the package
                hierarchy but rather linked with threads.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that the mentioned call stack contains only the to be observed methods and is therefore separate from the call stack
                managed by the JVM. At every push and pop of a method image a corresponding entry together with the class name and the system
                ID of the owning object will be generated within the trace-log. In the event of a pop the consumed (CPU-)time will additionally
                be quoted.
            </p>
            <p>
                The line-oriented, sequential view of traditional loggers tends to get in the way of generating meaningful dumps of complex
                data structures operated by algorithms. This library helps you to create reports on-the-fly which show what is really going on.

        This document is the API specification for the TraceLogger library. This library helps to avoid errors and helps to debug errors
        during the development of complex software systems on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) by providing clearly
        arranged (trace-)logs. That is, in contrast to conventional loggers the call stack of the to be observed methods is 
        presented by indenting the trace messages dependent on the actual depth of the call stack. A distinction
        is made between fine granular trace messages (entering and exiting of methods, debugging output) and
        conventional log messages (error, warning and info notifications). For production the latter ones can be
        redirected to a conventional logging system like log4j whereas the trace messages will be discarded. Several strategies
        to access tracers can be employed. Tracers can be accessed by name, can be mapped on threads and be retrieved
        by invoking a blocking queue. Unlike conventional java loggers, these tracers aren't linked with the package hierarchy
        but rather linked with threads.
